# Charity-Nyamuchengwa

 Iâ€™m a Data Analyst and budding Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in data analysis, M&E, and real-world impact tracking. I work with tools like Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to explore data, build models, and communicate insights clearly.
My background includes both monitoring & evaluation in development programs and technical projects involving predictive modeling, data cleaning, and dashboard development. I care about using data not just to build models, but to solve practical problems and support decision-making.
