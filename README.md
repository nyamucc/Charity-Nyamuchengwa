📌 About Me in 30 Seconds
I’m a Data Analyst and budding Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in data analysis, monitoring & evaluation (M&E), and real-world impact tracking.

I work with tools like Python 🐍 (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), SQL 🧮, Power BI 📊, and Tableau 📈 to explore data, build models, and communicate insights clearly.

My background blends experience in development programs and M&E with technical projects like:

🔍 Predictive modeling
🧹 Data cleaning and automation
📊 Dashboard development
I care about using data not just to build models, but to solve real-world problems and support better decision-making — especially in the nonprofit, public health, and development spaces.
