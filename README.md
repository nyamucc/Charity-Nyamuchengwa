I’m a Data Analyst and aspiring Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with a solid background in statistics, strategic information systems, and real-world impact evaluation
based in United States.

I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science 🎓 and bring over 5 years of experience working across industries to make data useful, understandable, and actionable.

🧮 I worked as a Statistical Analyst for 4 years at a transport and logistics company, analyzing operational and performance data.
❤️ Later, I served as a Strategic Information & Evaluation Assistant at a health-focused NGO, supporting monitoring, evaluation, and data-driven program decisions for 1 year.
I specialize in:

- 🐍 Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- 💾 SQL & database queries
- 📊 Power BI & Tableau for dashboard development
- 🧹 Data cleaning & pipeline automation
-📋 Monitoring & Evaluation reporting and indicator tracking
- 🤖 Machine Learning (classification, regression, clustering, NLP basics)
-  🔍 Statistical Analysis and hypothesis testing
  
I’m passionate about using data not just for analysis or prediction — but to support smarter, more impactful decisions, especially in development, public health, and social good.
